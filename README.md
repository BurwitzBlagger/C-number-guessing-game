# C-number-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game written in C. To run it, just click the green Code button > Download ZIP > Extract then double click the .exe file. The .c file is the source code and isn't necessary for the .exe to run. Both files can be renamed and moved without corruption or anything. If you want to increase the number range and make it harder, just edit the .c with an IDE like Code::Blocks.



How to play: Start by entering a random number in the range of 1-100 and follow the clues on the screen to find the hidden number. Every time you launch the game, it generates a random 1-100 hidden number, so if you're lucky, you may get it in the first shot. If you aren't that lucky, you may get something similar to this example:
The hidden number is 18, you type 67. The game will display "Try a smaller number!".
