# C-number-guessing-game
How to play: Start by entering a random number in the range of 1-100 and follow the clues on the screen to find the hidden number. Every time you launch the game, it generates a random 1-100 hidden number, so if you're lucky, you may get it in the first shot. If you aren't that lucky, you may get something similar to this example:
The hidden number is 18, you type 67. The game will display "Try a smaller number!".
