# C-number-guessing-game
How to play: Start by entering a random number in the range of 1-100 and follow the hints on the screen to find the hidden number. Every time you launch the game, it generates a random 1-100 hidden number, so if you're lucky, you may get it in the first shot. If you aren't that lucky and enter the wrong number, it will display "Try a smaller number!" or "Try a bigger nunber!".
